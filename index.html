    <h1> About Me</h1>

   <img src="http://i.imgur.com/vDAYpq0.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

    <P>Hello, my name is Abigail Nino, I am currently the Assisntant Merchendise Manager at the Qmart store in Jarrell, Texas. I love being out in nature and going on long hikes. I love to cook, my favorite dish to make is cheese empanadas with spanish rice. During my freetime I like to go to the park and walk along the river, I also like to catch a good movie from time to time as well as go to the gym.</P>

    <h1> My Background</h1>

    <p>I was born and raised in Georgetown, Texas and graduated in 2014 from Georgetown High. My freshman year I took a computer class that taught me the minimal basics of computer programming in Java and C++, my favorite class though, was Environmental Science. I did not attend college after high school, I wasnt ready and I realized everyone has a time for things and my time would come soon enough. Fast forward three years after high school and I still wasnt in college but decided I was ready to take the next step. Now I am begging to learn a trade in a very in demand feel and I couldn't be more excited!</p>

    <h1> Why I Decided To Learn Computer Programming</h1>

    <p>I decided to learn computer programming shortly after I built my own computer. I origionally built it to be a gaming computer but did not use it to its full potential. After searching the web for fun programms to run on my computer I came across computer languages and it opened up a new door for me. I did a bit a research and became interested very quickly. Knowing that there was a high demand for computer programmers close to the area I grew up in, I knew this was where I wanted to take my next step in furthering my education. We live in a new world where technology is litteraly at our fingertips and we need to learn to adapt if we want to keep up. I do have a passion for Programming, but my heart wants to go towards  Energy Engineering, if I can program a computer, what more can I do to make something even greater! Not just for me, but hopefully for the world! I feel like computer programming is a step in the right direction that I want to go in and that's why I decided to learn computer programming.</p>
